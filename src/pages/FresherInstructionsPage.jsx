    title: 'The Real IT Market Situation',
    brief: 'Hiring has genuinely slowed at large companies — but new doors have opened elsewhere.',
    content: 'This is the honest picture — not filtered for comfort.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2025, major IT service companies reduced fresher hiring significantly. TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Cognizant — who once hired 30,000–50,000 freshers per year — cut batch sizes by 40–60%. This happened for real reasons:\n• Post-COVID over-hiring correction\n• AI and automation handling work that previously needed entry-level developers\n• Global economic slowdown reducing client budgets\n\nAt the same time, FAANG and big tech companies globally laid off over 300,000 employees in 2022–2024. Tech is no longer immune to economic cycles.\n\nBUT — here is what is also growing:\n• Global Capability Centers (GCCs): 1,700+ GCCs in India now, adding lakhs of quality jobs. Companies like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Boeing, and Google have major India engineering centers.\n• AI/ML, Cloud, Cybersecurity, and DevOps roles are in shortage — and paying 30–50% more than regular dev roles.\n• Product startups, SaaS companies, and D2C tech companies are still actively hiring.\n• Demand for engineers who can work with AI tools is growing faster than supply.\n\nThe conclusion: the era of mass bulk hiring at service companies is slowing. The era of quality hiring is growing. Fewer seats, but the seats that exist are going to freshers who actually stand out.',

Volume has genuinely dropped.\n• "Competition is very high" — TRUE. More engineering graduates, fewer seats at top companies.\n• "AI is affecting entry-level jobs" — TRUE. Basic coding tasks, manual testing, and data entry are being automated right now.\n• "Getting placed is harder than it was in 2019–2022" — TRUE. That period was unusual. This period is the new normal.\n\nACTUAL MYTHS:\n• "All IT hiring has completely stopped" — Wrong. Different companies and different roles are actively hiring.\n• "Only top college students get placed" — Wrong. Skills and real projects matter more than college brand in most companies.\n• "AI will replace all developers soon" — Wrong. AI replaces tasks, not roles that require judgment, design, and problem-solving.\n• "I need to master everything before applying" — Wrong. Apply when you have solid basics + real projects. Waiting for perfection is a trap.\n• "Certifications alone will get me a job" — Wrong. Certificates with no applied knowledge impress nobody.\n\nThe right mindset: acknowledge what is hard about the market, then prepare specifically for what companies are actually hiring for today — not for the market of five years ago.',

Companies now expect this.\n• Debugging ability: can you find a bug you did not create? This is rare and valued.\n• Deployment: did you actually host your project? Vercel, Render, Railway — this shows you built something real.\n• Understanding over memorization: interviewers now ask "why did you use this approach?" not just "what is this?"\n\nWHAT COMPANIES NO LONGER CARE ABOUT:\n• CGPA above 8 (unless it is a filter for shortlisting)\n• Knowing 5+ programming languages at surface level\n• Certificates from online platforms without applied work\n• Resumes padded with buzzwords but no real projects\n\nBottom line: a fresher with 2 well-built, deployed, explainable projects will always outperform a fresher with 10 certifications and no code.',

    brief: 'AI writes code. Only you can understand it, verify it, and fix it. That requires fundamentals.',
    content: 'Here is something most students do not realize:\n\nAI tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT can generate code in seconds. Any fresher can generate a working React app or a REST API by prompting an AI.\n\nSo if everyone can generate code — what makes YOU valuable?\n\nThe answer is: understanding what the code is doing, knowing when it is wrong, and being able to fix it.\n\nAI is confidently wrong. It generates code that looks correct but has hidden bugs, security vulnerabilities, or logic errors. The fresher who understands fundamentals can catch this. The fresher who does not — cannot.\n\nCritical fundamentals you must own:\n• Programming logic — control flow, recursion, edge cases\n• Data structures — arrays, linked lists, hashmaps, trees\n• Object-oriented programming — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, SOLID basics\n• Databases — write real SQL queries, understand indexes, know NoSQL basics\n• HTTP and APIs — understand request/response, status codes, authentication\n• Git — commit, branch, merge, resolve conflicts\n• Debugging — use breakpoints, read stack traces, isolate problems\n• System thinking — what happens when a user clicks a button, end to end\n\nWith strong fundamentals, you can work with any framework, in any company, with or without AI assistance. Without them, you will be exposed in any real interview.',

    brief: 'AI is replacing tasks, not roles. Know exactly which tasks — so you build skills above them.',
    content: 'This is the most important section. Read it carefully.\n\nWhat AI is genuinely replacing right now:\n• Writing boilerplate CRUD code (GitHub Copilot does this faster than any fresher)\n• Simple manual test case writing and basic test execution\n• Data entry, basic reporting, simple dashboards\n• Documentation writing and code commenting\n• Basic customer support and FAQ responses\n• Copy-paste integration of known APIs\n\nThis means: if your only skill is writing tutorial-level code, you are in direct competition with a free AI tool. That is a competition you will lose.\n\nWhat AI cannot replace:\n• Understanding what to build and why (requirements, product thinking)\n• System design and architecture — choosing the right approach for the right problem\n• Debugging complex, real-world issues in production systems\n• Understanding a client\'s actual business problem and translating it to technical solutions\n• Reviewing AI\'s own code and knowing when it is subtly wrong\n• Working with teams, building trust, communicating trade-offs\n• Making decisions under uncertainty with incomplete information\n\nThe honest insight:\nAI has raised the floor — even bad developers can now produce working code. But it has also raised the ceiling on what a skilled developer can accomplish. A good developer with AI tools does 3–5x the work.\n\nYour goal is not to compete with AI. Your goal is to become the person who directs AI, verifies its output, and delivers value that goes beyond what AI alone can produce.',

    title: 'How to Use AI Without Becoming Dependent',
    brief: 'There is a thin line between using AI as a tool and becoming unable to work without it.',
    content: 'Many students use AI the wrong way and create a hidden problem for themselves: they can generate code, but they cannot explain or fix it in interviews.\n\nThe right approach:\n\nStep 1: Understand the concept first — at least enough to know what you need\nStep 2: Attempt the problem yourself, even partially\nStep 3: Use AI to get unstuck, to explore, or to speed up known work\nStep 4: Read the AI output carefully — do not just copy-paste\nStep 5: Test it, break it, understand why it works\nStep 6: Be ready to explain every line in an interview\n\nWRONG use of AI:\n"Give me the complete project code for a student management system"\n\nRIGHT use of AI:\n"I am building a REST API in Spring Boot for student login. I have set up the User model and UserRepository. Now I want to implement JWT authentication. Explain the flow and show me the JwtFilter class."\n\nThe difference: in the right approach, you understand what you already built, you know what you need next, and you use AI for a specific, bounded task.\n\nPractical rule: If a recruiter asks you to explain any part of your project and you cannot — that project should not be on your resume. Every line you submit for evaluation must be something you can own.',

    title: 'Vibe Coding — What It Is and How to Use It Right',
    brief: 'The new way to build fast. Powerful when used right, dangerous when used blindly.',
    content: 'Vibe coding is a term coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early 2025. The idea: instead of writing every line of code yourself, you describe what you want in plain English, let AI generate it, and iterate by adjusting your description until the result is right. You are directing the AI like a product manager, not writing syntax like a programmer.\n\nThis approach is real and genuinely useful. Startups are using it to build prototypes in hours. Developers are shipping features 3–5x faster. Non-developers are building functional tools they could not have built before.\n\nWHEN VIBE CODING WORKS WELL:\n• Prototyping a new feature quickly to test an idea\n• Building small tools, scripts, or automations\n• Exploring an unfamiliar framework to see how it works\n• Generating boilerplate and standard patterns you already understand\n• Rapid iteration on UI layouts and designs\n\nWHEN IT GOES WRONG:\n• Using it to build your entire fresher project without understanding any of it\n• Skipping the step of reading and understanding the generated code\n• Vibe coding authentication, payment systems, or anything security-critical\n• Building on top of code you cannot explain when something breaks in production\n• Submitting vibe-coded projects to interviews without being able to explain them\n\nTHE RIGHT MINDSET FOR FRESHERS:\nVibe coding is a multiplier — it multiplies whatever skills you already have. With strong fundamentals, it makes you significantly more productive. Without fundamentals, it produces code you cannot maintain, debug, or explain.\n\nUse vibe coding to go faster on things you understand. Not to skip understanding things.\n\nPRACTICAL RULE: Before adding any AI-generated code to a project on your resume, read every file it produced, understand what it does, and be able to explain it in an interview. If you cannot — rewrite it yourself until you can. The portfolio project is for you to learn, not for AI to impress.',

It solves a real problem — even a small one\n   "Track my college assignments with deadlines and reminders" is more interesting than "CRUD todo app"\n\n3. It has real authentication — not fake login with hardcoded passwords\n   JWT, session handling, protected routes\n\n4. You can explain every decision:\n   Why did you use this database? Why this framework? What would you change if you had more time?\n\n5. You added something your own — not just followed a YouTube tutorial line by line\n   One original feature, one improvement, one thing that came from your own thinking\n\n6.

Companies want developers who can ship code, not just write it.\n• AI integration — Using OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini APIs to build features. Connecting AI capabilities to real applications.\n• Full-stack JavaScript — React + Node.js + MongoDB is still the fastest path to building complete applications.\n• Python for data/AI — If you are interested in data roles, Python with Pandas, NumPy, and basic ML concepts is valuable.\n• Cybersecurity basics — Every company needs people who understand secure coding, OWASP Top 10, and basic threat awareness.\n\nDECLINING DEMAND (do not over-invest):\n• Manual QA testing without automation skills\n• Basic data entry and reporting roles\n• Simple frontend without any backend knowledge\n\nSAME AS ALWAYS (non-negotiable everywhere):\n• Java or Python fundamentals — one of these is required for most backend roles\n• SQL — database querying is a basic skill for almost every tech role\n• Git and GitHub — if you cannot version control your work, you are not hireable\n\nYou do not need to learn everything.

Cybersecurity roles are understaffed. Cloud engineers are in demand. Every company in every industry now needs technology.\n\nThe opportunity is not gone. It has shifted.\n\nWHO IS GETTING PLACED RIGHT NOW:\nNot the students who memorized the most. The ones getting placed can explain their projects clearly. They built and deployed something real. They know their fundamentals well enough to catch AI mistakes. They applied broadly, not just to the top 5 companies. They showed up prepared, communicated honestly, and demonstrated they could learn.\n\nTHE HONEST ADVICE:\nDo not study for the market of 2020. Study for the market of 2026. Learn to work with AI, not against it. Build real things. Deploy them. Go deep on one skill instead of shallow on ten.
