      <p className="info-page__intro">
        LearnToEarn is a free learning platform built for students — especially freshers and
        final-year students who want to go from <strong>zero knowledge to job-ready</strong>.
        Instead of endless video playlists, everything here works on a simple leveling system:
        you start as a beginner, clear one skill at a time, prove it in a test, and level up
        step by step until you reach expert level.
      </p>

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">01</span> The Leveling System</h2>
        <p>
          Every subject on the platform is a <strong>gate</strong> — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python,
          React, Spring Boot, SQL, and more. Each gate contains focused skills (concepts) with clear
          explanations, real code examples, live previews, and a short test. Pass the test, earn XP,
          and your rank climbs:
        </p>
        <div className="info-ranks">
          {RANKS.map(r => (
            <span key={r.label} className="info-ranks__chip" style={{ '--rank-color': r.color }}>
              {r.label} · {r.name}
            </span>
          ))}
        </div>
        <p>
          Ranks are earned, never given. Every badge on your profile is backed by a real assessment —
          which means when you say you know a skill, you can prove it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">02</span> What's Inside</h2>

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">03</span> Why This Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Most students don't fail because they lack ability — they fail because they don't know
          <strong> what to learn, in what order, and how to prove it</strong>. Tutorials pile up,
          motivation drops, and there's no way to show progress to a recruiter.
        </p>
        <p>
          LearnToEarn fixes that with structure: a clear path from beginner to expert, small wins
          every day, tests that verify real understanding, and projects that become portfolio proof.
          Learn the skills. Earn the job.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">04</span> Who It's For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>College students and recent graduates starting from scratch</li>
          <li>Freshers preparing for their first tech job or internship</li>
          <li>Students building final-year or mini projects</li>
          <li>Anyone who prefers structured, provable progress over passive watching</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Everything works without payment. You can even explore as a <strong>guest</strong> before
          creating an account.
