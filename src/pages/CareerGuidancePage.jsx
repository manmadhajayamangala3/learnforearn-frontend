    passion: 'Good fit if you enjoy visual design, care about how things look and feel, and like immediate visual feedback when you write code.',
    aiImpact: 'AI generates UI code fast — but design judgment, UX thinking, and knowing why something feels right is human. Your value moves toward product sense, not just code.',
    future: 'Growing. Design-engineering hybrid roles are emerging. React skills stay in demand for years.',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React or Vue'],
    salary: '₹3.5L – ₹8L (fresher)',

    demand: 'Very High', color: '#4ADE80',

    passion: 'Good fit if you like logic over visuals, enjoy thinking about performance and data flow, and do not need instant visual results to feel satisfied.',
    aiImpact: 'AI writes boilerplate REST APIs quickly — but system design, performance under load, security architecture, and debugging complex failures need human thinking.',
    future: 'Very stable. Every product company needs strong backend. Java and Python backend roles are a long-term career.',
    skills: ['Java or Python or Node.js', 'SQL', 'REST APIs', 'Spring Boot or Django'],
    salary: '₹4L – ₹10L (fresher)',

    demand: 'Highest', color: '#9B6ED4',
    desc: 'You own the full product — frontend, backend, database, deployment. Startups love this because one person can ship a complete feature without waiting on others.',

    aiImpact: 'AI helps across the stack, but integration thinking — understanding how frontend, backend, and DB talk to each other — is where full stack developers show their value.',

    aiImpact: 'AI is automating manual test case generation. If your only skill is manual testing, this role will shrink for you. Learn Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress — automation QA is still in demand.',

    aiImpact: 'AI helps write deployment configs and scripts — but infrastructure decisions, security configurations, and knowing what to do when production breaks at 2am cannot be automated.',

            Every year, freshers pick a tech stack for the wrong reasons — because a YouTube video made it look cool, because a friend is doing it, because someone said it pays well. They spend 12 months learning something, get a job, and hate the work within 6 months.
