        LearnToEarn is built for students, and your privacy is treated with the same care as your
        learning progress. This page explains exactly what data is collected, why, and what happens
        to it. Short version: <strong>only what's needed to run the platform, never sold, no ad tracking.</strong>
      </p>

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">01</span> Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account details</strong> — your name, email address, and college name (provided at registration). Passwords are stored only as secure one-way hashes — nobody, including us, can read them.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning progress</strong> — completed skills, quiz attempts, scores, XP, ranks, badges, and enrolled paths. This is the core of the platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Guest sessions</strong> — a random device identifier stored in your browser so your guest progress survives between visits. No personal details are collected for guests.</li>
          <li><strong>Content you submit</strong> — walk-in posts, feedback, and issue reports.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect payment details (the platform is free), precise location, or contacts.</p>
      </div>

        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">02</span> Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One authentication cookie</strong> — a secure, httpOnly session cookie that keeps you logged in for 24 hours. JavaScript cannot read it, which protects it from common attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Local storage</strong> — your theme preference (dark/light) and guest device identifier.</li>
          <li><strong>Session storage</strong> — short-lived caching of platform content so pages load faster. Cleared when the tab closes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are <strong>no advertising cookies, no third-party trackers, and no analytics profiles</strong>.</p>
      </div>

        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">03</span> How Your Data Is Used</h2>

        <p>The platform runs on trusted infrastructure providers that process data solely to operate the service:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — hosts the website you see</li>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2 className="info-section__title"><span className="info-section__num">05</span> Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All traffic is encrypted over HTTPS</li>
          <li>Passwords are hashed with an industry-standard algorithm (BCrypt)</li>
          <li>Login sessions use httpOnly cookies inaccessible to page scripts</li>
